# 🎯 Tasks

## Things to do that don't involve Pyvene:

✅ Intialize a random resnetForImageClassification model without any pretraining

❌ Create the PVR MNIST dataset using the CausalModel 

❌ Train resnet on this dataset without any interventions

## How to set up in pyvene:

✅ Create a folder for the resnet model with resnet_modelings_intervenable.py in it

✅ Create the type_to_module_mapping, type_to_dimension mapping, a create model function

✅ Modify the dictionary in constants.py to include resnet

✅ Add a topological ordering to the constants.py
