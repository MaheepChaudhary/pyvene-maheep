# Training, Intervention and (training + intervention)

## Training of ResNet on PVR-MNIST Dataset.

The training accuracy of the ResNet model turn out to be the following when trained on PVR-MNIST Dataset:

```
100%|██████████| 5/5 [4:27:59<00:00, 3215.85s/it]Epoch 5, Train Loss: 0.0936, Train Accuracy: 96.96%, Val Accuracy: 93.37%
```

As for the evaluation on the testing dataset with certain conditions, the statistics are certainly failing with accuracy as following:
